# Impetum, a first-person base-building game for the Web

\[Image Placeholder\]

## Concept

- Find a crystal / ore deposit and place miners to gain resources
- Use the genereated resources to **build and fortify your base**
- Enemies spawn in waves as you start to mine for resources
  - Place walls or fences to obstruct them from getting to your miners
  - Deploy towers to fend them off before they can get past your defenses
  - Engage in combat to fight off a particular enemy
- Once the enemies get to your miners and manage to destroy them, the game is over
